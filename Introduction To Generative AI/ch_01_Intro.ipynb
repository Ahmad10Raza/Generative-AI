    "# Defination ?\n",
    "Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to generate new content, data, or outputs that resemble or are related to existing information. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on rule-based programming or supervised learning where the model is trained on labeled data, generative AI models are trained to understand patterns and structures within data and then generate new, similar data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key techniques used in generative AI is the concept of generative models, which are trained on large datasets to learn and capture the underlying patterns. These models can then generate new instances of data by drawing on the learned patterns. Generative AI has applications across various domains, including image generation, text generation, music composition, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "One prominent example of generative AI is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In a GAN, two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator creates new content, and the discriminator evaluates whether the generated content is real or fake. This iterative process leads to the generation of increasingly realistic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI has the potential to be creative and innovative, but it also raises ethical considerations, especially when it comes to the creation of deepfakes or other forms of synthetic content that may be used for malicious purposes. As the field continues to advance, it is important to explore and address these ethical challenges while harnessing the positive potential of generative AI for various applications."
