    "\n",
    "Use **Donut** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need **structured extraction** (e.g., invoice number, total, date).\n",
    "* Your documents are **scanned** or **layout matters**.\n",
    "* You want to **avoid OCR** and handle messy formats natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ When to Use **Ollama (LLaMA/Mistral etc.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Ollama** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can **OCR the invoice first** to get clean text.\n",
    "* You want a **lightweight local LLM** for prompt-based extraction.\n",
    "* You don't need layout-level precision.\n",
    "* You want a **general-purpose assistant** that can summarize, extract info, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Example Ollama Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OCR the invoice to text using Tesseract or any API.\n",
    "2. Use a prompt like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Extract these fields from the invoice:\n",
    "   - Invoice Number\n",
    "   - Vendor Name\n",
    "   - Amount\n",
    "   - Date\n",
    "\n",
    "   Text: [OCR_RESULT]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Run it via:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ollama run mistral\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 Automate via Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
